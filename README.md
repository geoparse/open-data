# Open Data Preprocessing

This repository provides scripts for downloading, preprocessing and exporting open data into Parquet format.
It regularly ingests and serves the ONS and Ordnance Survey datasets.

# Prerequisites

<details>
<summary><h2>DuckDB</h2></summary>

This repository uses `DuckDB`, a lightweight, in-process analytical database designed for fast querying of large datasets. Unlike traditional database servers, `DuckDB` runs directly inside your scripts or applications and can query files such as `CSV` and `Parquet` without requiring data to be imported first. It is often described as “SQLite for analytics” due to its simplicity and efficiency for analytical workloads. We use `DuckDB` to export files to the `Parquet` format.

```bash
brew install duckdb

```

<details>
<summary><h2>GDAL</h2></summary>
Before running the scripts in this repository, ensure that [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) is installed on your system. `GDAL` (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and `OGR` (OGR Simple Features Library) are essential tools for working with geospatial data. `GDAL` is designed for reading, writing, and processing raster geospatial data, such as satellite images and digital elevation models. It supports a variety of raster formats, including GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG, and HDF5. On the other hand, `OGR` is specialized in handling vector geospatial data, including points, lines, and polygons, and supports formats like Shapefiles, GeoJSON, KML, PostGIS, and OSM PBF. 

A powerful feature within `GDAL/OGR` is the `ogr2ogr` command-line utility, which is dedicated to vector data manipulation and conversion. `ogr2ogr` allows users to convert vector data between formats (e.g., Shapefile to GeoJSON), filter and subset data using SQL-like queries, and reproject data to different coordinate reference systems (e.g., transforming WGS84 to a local `EPSG` code).

In summary, `GDAL` is tailored for raster data, `OGR` for vector data, and `ogr2ogr` provides versatile tools for converting, filtering, and reprojecting vector datasets.


On Debian-based Systems:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdal-bin

```

On macOS:
```bash
brew update
brew install gdal

```

You can upgrade GDAL on your system if it is already installed.
```bash
brew upgrade gdal    # macOS
sudo apt install --only-upgrade gdal-bin    # Debian

```

After completing the installation, verify it by running the following commands:
```bash
gdalinfo --version
ogrinfo --version

```

Both commands should return output similar to:

`GDAL 3.11.3 "Eganville", released 2025/07/12`

<summary><h2>1. ONS UPRN Directory</h2></summary>

Source: [ONS UPRN Directory](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/a615e841-c79e-4566-a422-0618faca9634/ons-uprn-directory-october-2025-epoch-121)
Last updated: 21 October 2025

Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) is a unique identifier assigned to every addressable location in the United Kingdom, including residential and commercial properties, land parcels, and other structures such as bus shelters or community assets. Managed by Ordnance Survey, the UPRN acts as a consistent reference point across different datasets and systems, ensuring that information from local authorities, government bodies, and private organisations can be accurately linked to the same physical location. Because it is stable over the lifetime of the property or land parcel, the UPRN plays a vital role in data integration, geocoding, property analytics, and service delivery, helping organisations reduce duplication, improve accuracy, and make better evidence-based decisions.

You can download the latest UPRN dataset from [Ordnance Survey Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUPRN). Choose the `CSV` format, as it is smaller and faster to process than the `GeoPackage` version. 

Alternatively, you can run the script directly:

```bash

curl -L -J -O https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/ad7564917fe94ae4aea6487321e36325/data

duckdb -c "
COPY (
  SELECT
    UPRN as uprn, 
    GRIDGB1E as easting,
    GRIDGB1N as northing,
    PCDS as postcode,           -- Postcode string with spaces
    CTRY25CD as country,        -- Country code
    RGN25CD as region,          -- Region code
    CTY25CD as county,          -- County code
    PFA23CD as police_force,    -- Police force area code
    msoa21cd   as msoa,           -- Middle Layer Super Output Area code
    lsoa21cd as lsoa,           -- Lower Layer Super Output Area code
    OA21CD as oa,               -- Output Area code
  FROM read_csv_auto('$csv_file', sample_size=-1)       -- Read entire file for schema detection
) TO '$parquet_file';  -- Output to Parquet file
"







./os-open-uprn.sh

```
This will download, process, and save the latest OS Open UPRN dataset as a `Parquet` file in the `data/os-open-uprn/` directory.
We convert the dataset to a `Parquet` file (using `DuckDB`) instead of a `GeoParquet` file (using `ogr2ogr`) because reading standard `Parquet` files with `pandas` is significantly faster than loading `GeoParquet` files with `geopandas` in Python.

<summary><h2>2. ONS Postcode Directory</h2></summary>

Source: [ONS Postcode Directory](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/3793b22f-895a-491e-9388-63060189bcbb/onspd-online-latest-postcode-centroids)

The `ONS Postcode Directory` is a comprehensive dataset from the Office for National Statistics that provides geographic coordinates for every postcode unit across the UK. The dataset covers over 2.7 million postcodes, with approximately 1.8 million currently active.
Each record includes the postcode, its precise location and associated administrative boundary codes such as country, region, county and output area. 
Released under the Open Government Licence, it can be freely used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes with proper attribution.

The following script provides an automated pipeline for downloading, cleansing and converting postcode data into Parquet files.

```bash
./ons-postcode-directory.sh

```

The script automatically:
* Downloads the latest ONS Postcode Directory from ArcGIS Hub
* Cleanses and validates the data
* Converts coordinates to WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
* Outputs to compressed Parquet format

The generated Parquet file contains postcode-level geographic and administrative information with the following structure:

| Column            | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **postcode**      | The standard spaced version of the postcode (e.g., “GL4 5EB”).  |
| **intr_date**     | Date (YYYYMM) when the postcode was introduced.                 |
| **term_date**     | Date (YYYYMM) when the postcode was terminated (NaN if active). |
| **user_type**     | User type indicator (0 = small users, 1 = large users).         |
| **country**       | ONS country code.                                               |
| **region**        | ONS region code.                                                |
| **county**        | County code (if applicable).                                    |
| **police_force**  | Police force area code.                                         |
| **msoa**          | Middle Layer Super Output Area 2021 code.                       |
| **lsoa**          | Lower Layer Super Output Area 2021 code.                        |
| **oa**            | Output Area 2021 code.                                          |
| **rural_urban**   | Rural–urban classification code.                                |
| **national_park** | National park area code (if applicable).                        |
| **lat**           | Latitude coordinate (WGS84).                                    |
| **lon**           | Longitude coordinate (WGS84).                                   |

The following sample shows the data structure stored in the Parquet file:


| postcode | intr_date | term_date | user_type | country   | region    | county    | police_force | msoa      | lsoa      | oa        | rural_urban | national_park | lat      | lon       |

<summary><h2>3. OS Open USRN</h2></summary>

Source: [https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUSRN](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUSRN)

Unique Street Reference Number (USRN), is a nationally recognised identifier used in Great Britain to uniquely reference every street, including roads, footpaths, cycleways and alleys. It forms part of the national addressing system and is maintained through the [National Street Gazetteer](https://www.geoplace.co.uk/addresses-streets/street-data-and-services/national-street-gazetteer), which is compiled and updated by local authorities. Much like the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) identifies individual properties, the USRN ensures that each street has a consistent reference across different datasets and organisations. This makes it essential for activities such as managing streetworks permits, supporting navigation and transport planning, enabling emergency services, and integrating data across government and utility providers.

You can download the latest USRN dataset from [Ordnance Survey Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUSRN) as a `GeoPackage` file. 
The following command displays detailed information about the GeoPackage file's structure and contents.

```bash
ogrinfo -al -so osopenusrn_202509.gpkg

```

**Command Breakdown:**
* `ogrinfo`: GDAL/OGR utility for getting information about geospatial datasets
* `-al`: All layers - shows information about all layers in the dataset
* `-so`: Summary only - shows only the summary (no feature data)
* `osopenusrn_202509.gpkg`: The input GeoPackage file


This following commands downloads the GeoPackage file, process and export it into a Parquet file using `ogr2ogr`.

```bash
mkdir -p data/os-open-usrn
cd $_

curl -L "https://api.os.uk/downloads/v1/products/OpenUSRN/downloads?area=GB&format=GeoPackage&redirect" -o usrn.zip
unzip -o $_
rm $_

gpkg_file=$(ls *.gpkg)
parquet_file="${gpkg_file%.*}.parquet"

ogr2ogr $parquet_file $gpkg_file -dim 2 -unsetFid  -t_srs EPSG:4326 -makevalid

ls -lh
cd ../../

```
Here's what each part of the `ogr2ogr` does:

* `ogr2ogr`: GDAL/OGR utility for converting geospatial data between formats
* `osopenusrn_202509.parquet`: Output file (Parquet format)
* `osopenusrn_202509.gpkg`: Input file (GeoPackage format)
* `-dim 2`: Forces 2D coordinates only (removes Z/elevation values)
* `-unsetFid`: Prevents FID column from being exported to output
* `-t_srs EPSG:4326`: Reprojects data to WGS84 (latitude/longitude)
* `-makevalid`: Attempts to fix invalid geometries

<summary><h2>5. OpenStreetMap (OSM)</h2></summary>

Source: [https://download.geofabrik.de/](https://download.geofabrik.de/)

The following script is an automation pipeline to download and convert OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into Parquet files, layer by layer.

```bash
REGION='europe'
COUNTRY='united-kingdom'
mkdir -p data/geofabrik-osm/$COUNTRY
cd $_

wget https://download.geofabrik.de/$REGION/$COUNTRY-latest.osm.pbf

ogrinfo $COUNTRY-latest.osm.pbf | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d' ' -f2 | tail -n +3 | while read layer; do ogr2ogr ${layer}.parquet $COUNTRY-latest.osm.pbf $layer; done

ls -lh
cd ../../../

```

Here’s what each step does in the last command:

`ogrinfo $COUNTRY-latest.osm.pbf` prints available layers (e.g. `points`, `lines`, `multilinestrings`, `multipolygons`, `other_relations`).

* `cut -d: -f2` → removes the layer number (e.g. 1: points → points).

* `cut -d' ' -f2` → extracts the actual layer name.

* `tail -n +3` → skips the first two non-layer lines.

```bash
while read layer; do
    ogr2ogr ${layer}.parquet $COUNTRY-latest.osm.pbf $layer
done
```
For each layer name, `ogr2ogr` extracts it from the `.osm.pbf` and saves it as a separate Parquet file (e.g. points.parquet, lines.parquet, …) for easier analysis.

The Excel file on the above page contains separate sheets for:

* Total annual household income
* Net annual income
* Net income before housing costs
* Net income after housing costs

Data are provided at the `Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)` level for England and Wales.
Each MSOA is represented by three values — the `lower confidence limit`, `mean estimate`, and `upper confidence limit` 
which together form a 95% confidence interval.
A `95% confidence interval` means that we can be 95% confident the true mean household income 
for each area lies between the lower and upper confidence limits. For further details, see the [Technical Report from Office for Natioanl Statistics, page 30.](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/methodologies/smallareaincomeestimatesmodelbasedestimatesofthemeanhouseholdweeklyincomeformiddlelayersuperoutputareas201314technicalreport/householdincometechnicalreport.pdf)

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides boundary data for the UK countries and the regions of England, available in multiple spatial resolutions and coastline treatments to balance accuracy and performance. Each boundary file includes a suffix such as `BFC`, `BFE`, `BGC`, `BSC`, or `BUC` that indicates both the detail level and whether the boundary is clipped to the coastline or includes the extent of the realm (i.e., offshore areas).
These options let you balance geometric accuracy with file size and performance, depending on your analysis or mapping needs.

Use full resolution versions (BFC/BFE) for analysis or precise overlays, and generalised versions (BGC/BSC/BUC) for visualisation, web mapping, or when handling large datasets.
Choose “clipped” versions when you only need land boundaries, or “extent of realm” when including sea/offshore territories is important.

| Code    | Meaning                                                       | Detail                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **BFE** | Boundary – Full resolution, *Extent of the Realm*             | Highest-detail geometry including offshore areas and islands.            |
| **BFC** | Boundary – Full resolution, *Clipped to coastline*            | Same high-detail boundary, but trimmed at the mean high-water coastline. |
| **BGC** | Boundary – Generalised (~20 m), *Clipped to coastline*        | Simplified geometry suitable for most mapping and display purposes.      |
| **BSC** | Boundary – Super-generalised (~200 m), *Clipped to coastline* | Coarser generalisation for lightweight, large-scale mapping.             |
| **BUC** | Boundary – Ultra-generalised (~500 m), *Clipped to coastline* | Smallest and simplest file size, least geometric detail.                 |

For process the files you need to download the `GeoPackage` files from the following pages for all spatial resolutions (`BFC`, `BFE`, `BGC`, `BSC`, and `BUC`).

[Countries](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=BDY_CTRY%3BDEC_2024&sort=Title%7Ctitle%7Casc) and 
[Regions](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=BDY_RGN%3BDEC_2024&sort=Title%7Ctitle%7Casc)

Make sure you downloaded 10 `GeoPackage` files and Then run the following scrips to process and to convert them to `Parquet` format.


```bash

./ons-country-region.sh

```
